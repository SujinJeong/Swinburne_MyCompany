Duties of a game developer may include: </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Creating story lines and character biographies </li> 
   <li>Conducting design reviews </li> 
   <li>Designing role-play mechanics </li> 
   <li>Creating prototypes for staff and management </li> 
   <li>Documenting game design process </li> 
  </ol>
